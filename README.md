# ThumbNailGenerator
Fast, Semi-Automated, Generation of Cropped, Scaled and Thumbnail Images from Sections of Multiple Images

The purpose of the ThumbNailGenerator software is to enable the user to open up a large scale image, choose an area to convert to a 600x600 format, 
save the resulting cropped and scaled image to a directory and then either automatically move the to next image or, alternately, extract a subsquent
cropped and scaled image from the same original. A 100x100 thumbnail image is also created for each 600x600 image.

This project was created to meet a specific purpose for a given set of input and output requirements. The software is not polished and has not been productionised. 
This means that it is not as smooth and generic as might be desired - there are, however, no known bugs. In addition, please realize that now that
the software has done the job for which it was intended, it is essentially over as far as the author is concerned. Having said that, if you do make improvements or enhancements that would 
be useful to others (and which you would like to share) please generate a pull request.

The home page for this project can be found at [http://www.OfItselfSo.com/ThumbNailGenerator](http://www.OfItselfSo.com/ThumbNailGenerator). Please read the contents
of that page for detailed information regarding the softwares capabilities and usage instructions. A binary file is also available for those who do not wish to compile the C# source themselves.
